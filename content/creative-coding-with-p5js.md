## Materials

- [Cheatsheet](https://bmoren.github.io/p5js-cheat-sheet/)

## Lesson 1

- Creative Coding introduction
- Course outline
- Inspirational projects
- Conditional Design activity
- Editor introduction (https://editor.p5js.org/) and account setup
- **Homework**: Pick up a creative coding project you like the most

## Lesson 2

- Play with the console with `print()` command understanding math and string concatenation
- How to comment code.
- **Exercise**: get used with the syntax creating sentences about activity you performed with text and calculated numbers such as `print("I've bought" + (100/20+2) + "orange")`
- Coordinate system: understanding how it works and learn about `setup` and `draw` functions as well as the `createCanvas` and its parameters.
- **Exercise**: create 4 rectangles in a grid layout
- Basic shapes: after the `rect` command, let's explore `circle`, `line`, `triangle`, `arc`, etc.
- Understand the stack execution order and the specificity of the parameters
- **Exercise**: Create a simple face with the primitive shapes
- Let's color them: understand `fill`, `stroke`, `noFill`, `noStroke` and how to encode color parameters
- **Exercise**: Give some color to the face
- **Homework**: Create a dream house with the drawing commands

## Lesson 3

- Check exercises together

- **Functions**: what is a function, custom functions vs builtin functions to reuse  or execute complex commands on demand

- **Demonstration** of the verbose problem making the same symbol multiple times

- Understand the `translate` command

- **Exercise**: create 8 symbols, 2 rows using the translate compensation

- Demonstrate the rowFunction to make rows

- --- break ---

- **Variables**: introduction to the concept, builtin variables (width, height, frameCount, mouseX, mouseY)

- Show values with print, text, shapes prop, color

- **Exercise:** 2 circles, radius with mouseX/Y

- **Exercise**: 2 rect left/right with mouse in the middle

- **Exercise**: 4 rects top/bottom/left/right with mouse in the middle

- Homework: make an alien with multiple eyes (using function and translate), body and eyes color change with mouse position

- **Custom variables**: store and reuse of custom values, modify the value at run-time.

- Introduction of the `mousePressed` function to increment a variable

- **Exercise**: make a circle growing and following the mouse

- **Exercise**: make a color changer

- Include an image

- Homework: An alien using functions for multiple eyes, translate for position, mouseX to change body color

  

## Lesson 4

- Check Homework
- Reharshal **Function**, translate
- How to sandbox transformations? Introducing push/pop (example function with mouse translate and foreground static)
- Reharshal **Variables** built-in
- Example about using them
- Introduction Functions with parameters (user defined variables) with example
- Introducing custom Variables
- Introducing Random
- Introduction of the `keyPressed`  function to move an object
- **Exercise**: create an object that moves in the four directions with the keyboard arrow
- Introduction to the condition principle
- Es: change color with mouseX position, num click to show more objects
- Homework: Character configurator using **random**, **keypressed**, **variables**

## Lesson 5

- Check Homework
- Reharshal **Functions**, **Variables**, **Random**, **Condition**.
- **Conditions** more examples: boolean result + comparison operators: 
  - condition with background col static val, variable, mouseX, dyn var
  - using with keyPressed
- Introduction to the `time` functions with `print`, `text` and `circle` using  `map`
- Intermediate Project Brief,  the time as values: The interactive watch

## Lesson 6/10

- Introduction to the for-loop principle
- **Exercise**: create a list of object
- Understanding `sin` and `cos` and how to use them
- Noise
- FFT
- 3D
- Sound
- Scene structure
