# Hello! I'm Fabio Franchino

## Code, Design, Dataviz

<br />

A senior <span class="s">designer</span> + <span class="s">software developer</span> able to:



- prototype and develop <span class="s" data-type="underline">data-driven</span> software
- teach <span class="s" data-type="underline">coding</span> and <span class="s" data-type="underline">data visualization</span>
- manage <span class="s" data-type="underline">people</span> and <span class="s" data-type="underline">projects</span> in software development


### Want to talk?

A quick <span class="s" data-type="underline" data-color="#333">[e-mail](mailto:fabio.franchino@gmail.com)</span> is pretty damn good to start a conversation!

Oh! Did I mention that you don't have to accept any weird cookie banner?
<br />You're <span class="s" data-type="underline" data-color="#333">not tracked</span> at all.
