# Hello! I'm Fabio Franchino

## Coder, Designer, Dataviz(er)

<br />

I'm good at:

- Prototyping and developing <span class="s" data-type="underline">data-driven software</span>
- Teaching <span class="s" data-type="underline">creative coding</span> and <span class="s" data-type="underline">data visualization</span>
- <span class="s" data-type="underline">Managing teams</span> in software design and development

### Need to talk?

A quick <span class="s" data-type="box" data-color="#333">[e-mail](mailto:fabio.franchino@gmail.com)</span> is pretty damn good to start a conversation!

Oh! Did I mention you don't have to accept any weird cookie banner because you're **not tracked** at all?
