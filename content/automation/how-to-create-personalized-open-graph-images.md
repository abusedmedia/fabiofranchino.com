**Open Graph images** are those that appear when someone share a website URL on social platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin:

It works thanks to some specific HTML tags that need to be included in the `HEAD` tag, such as:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://mywebsite.net/assets/opengraph/card.jpg"/>
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Title"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="A full description of the page."/>
```

The `https://mywebsite.net/assets/opengraph/card.jpg` image is then loaded in the sharing box to provide a preview of the content to the user.

## The problem: the same image

A typical issue on many websites is that the image is always the same no matter the URL. Some systems (such as Wordpress) allows to customize the image by picking a specific image from the assets library.

It's a first step that allows to customize the Open Graph image to  a basic level. If you want to use a more interesting graphic composition, you have to create it manually for each website page:

BTW, the above image is not created manually, but using an **automatic software pipeline!**

## The solution: generate on-the-fly a personalized image

Solving this problem is possible by using a software pipeline that generates the image on-the-fly when it's requested by the social crawlers.

The following example is generated using fresh data of the specific [URL](https://www.fabiofranchino.com/blog/get-colors-from-images-in-bulk-with-node-js/):
