I've been quiet lately on this blog, due many reasons.

One of them is that I'm working on a new project, [ReChart](https://rechart.cc/), a javascript chart library specifically designed for [ReTool](https://retool.com/) platform.

I've been involved in ReTool lately and I do believe that it's going to change the software development landscape for many good reasons.

Aside that, I thought that the current [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) component in **ReTool** is far from to be optimal. This is why my take on this.

Let's see how it goes!
