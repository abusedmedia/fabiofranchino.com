title: About Me
---


I was born forty-and-something years ago. 
I'm italian and I currently live in my (still) beautiful country.

I've twenty years of experience in **computational design** and **web development**. 

I co-founded [TODO](https://todo.to.it/) back in 2007 serving as **CTO** role and I'm currently an independent senior designer/technologist.

I'm happy enough to lead teams from a vantage point at the crossroads of **design** and **coding**. I love exploring technologies and I'm passionate about **internal processes optimization** by means of Agile and innovative principles. I'm not satisfied by my actual knowledge, therefore, I constantly study something. Indeed, I'm an **ever learner** person.

My approach stems from a deep-rooted interest in creative disciplines, ranging from music to design, from performing to generative arts. In 2008 I conceived CSTEM, the first event devoted to computational design practices in art and design in Italy. I'm also a **keen educator** always been involved in teaching and lecturing at several institutions and workshops. I currently hold teaching positions at [MAIND SUPSI](https://www.maind.supsi.ch/) (creative coding and interaction design), [Big Dive training program](https://www.bigdive.eu/) (data visualization), [European Institute of Design](https://www.ied.it/) (creative coding) and [Scuola Holden](https://scuolaholden.it/) (creative coding).

I post updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabiofranchino), committing chunks of code on [Github](https://github.com/abusedmedia) and sometimes update professional info on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiofranchino/).
