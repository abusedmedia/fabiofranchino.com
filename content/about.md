title: About Me
---


I've more than fifteen years of experience in **computational design**, **data visualization** and **web development**. 

I co-founded <a href="https://www.todo.to.it/" rel="noreferrer">TODO</a> back in 2007 serving as **CTO**. Currently, I'm an independent senior **consultant**.

I'm happy to lead teams from a vantage point at the crossroads of **design** and **coding**. I love exploring technologies and I'm passionate about **internal processes optimization** by means of Lean/Agile principles. I'm not satisfied by my actual knowledge, therefore, I constantly study something. Indeed, I'm a **lifelong learner** person.

My approach stems from a deep-rooted interest in creative disciplines, ranging from music to design, from performing to generative arts. In 2006 I conceived [CSTEM](https://cstem.netlify.app/), the first event devoted to computational design practices in art and design in Italy. I'm also a **keen educator** always been involved in teaching and lecturing at several institutions and workshops. I currently hold teaching positions at [MAIND SUPSI](https://www.maind.supsi.ch/) (creative coding and interaction design), [Big Dive training program](https://www.bigdive.eu/) (data visualization) and [Scuola Holden](https://scuolaholden.it/) (creative coding).

I post what I find interesting on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabiofranchino), committing chunks of code on [Github](https://github.com/abusedmedia) and, rarely, update professional info on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiofranchino/).
