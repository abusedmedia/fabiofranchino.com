TIL the following options to manage small data with some structure:

- [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) is a markup parser for less tech-savvy people
- [Flat](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data) is the Github take to handle small data within repos

Note to myself: take a deeper look on them.
