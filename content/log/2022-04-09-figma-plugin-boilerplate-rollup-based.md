[Here](https://github.com/presenta-software/figma-rollup-plugin) a starter project if you want to develop a Figma plugin using Rollup as bundler and just vanilla javascript.

It's possible to add Typescript, in my use-case I wanted something more vanilla.

With this boilerplate you can easily using external libraries and ES6 scripts. Everything will be bundled according with the Figma requirements.

The `dist` folder will contains both the `code.js` file and the `ui.html` file with everything transpiled and injected.

Have fun!
