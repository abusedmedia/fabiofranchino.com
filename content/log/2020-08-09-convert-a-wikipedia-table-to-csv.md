I have a project in mind that requires a Wikipedia table as data source. Usually I'd scrape it with Node.js, converting in CSV format.

This time I though, maybe there's someone out there that already created such tool?

That's what I found quite easily, [Wikitable2CSV](https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/), from [this](https://gregorweichbrodt.de/) guy, does precisely that!

Very handy!
