.js

I'm poking with PDF.js library to figuring out the possibility to use PDF document as template source in PRESENTA Platform.

The idea is that a PDF can be used to create a PRESENTA template with a direct conversion.

I know that not everything can be converted, I'm interested mainly in the text boxes.

[Here](https://writingjavascript.com/how-to-extract-pdf-data-with-pdfjs) a very good article I used as starting point.
