A very [good example](https://cognition.happycog.com/article/writing-to-remember) about the power of writing as cognitive tool:

> “I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.”

or another quote from Beethoven:

> If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it in a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again.

In short, writing is a tool to become a better listener!
