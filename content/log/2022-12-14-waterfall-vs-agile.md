Great synthesis that worth a place in this site:

- in waterfall, you estimate time/effort to do a known set of features
- in agile, you estimate the features you can deliver in a known period

Waterfall guarantees what is delivered (but not when), and agile guarantees when the delivery happens (but not what is delivered).

> Fixed scope vs fixed time. Know the difference.
