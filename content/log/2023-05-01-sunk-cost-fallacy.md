If I buy some food and I realise that I don't want or need to eat that food, there's the high chance that I might eat it all because I'm influenced by the sunk cost fallacy. Since the food is already payed, I convince myself to eat it, even though I don't need it, and maybe it'd be better for my health not eating it all.

Another case, I bought a ticket for a movie that I've already watched or that I don't like it. Since I've already the ticked, I'd be influenced to attend the movie, in some way loosing my time to watch something I'm not interested, because the sunk cost of the ticket.
